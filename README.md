# React-Tutorial

I have created a column in [知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/c_68601936) to introduce the basic uses of react and its related libraries. And this project contains all the codes in the posts of that column.

The current writing language is Chinese as Chinese is my mother tongue. Later, if I have enough time, I will translate the posts into English.

### react-webpack-babel
My project is based on an open source project in github, i.e., [react-webpack-babel](https://github.com/alicoding/react-webpack-babel).

This project contains the most important modules for new react users.

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), 
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) 
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

### How to run the project

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.
* clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/alicoding/react-webpack-babel.git
```

* or just download it from github

* Then install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

* Run development server:

```
npm start
```

* Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8888/` and enjoy it
